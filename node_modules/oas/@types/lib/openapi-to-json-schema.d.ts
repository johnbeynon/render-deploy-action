/**
 * Given an OpenAPI-flavored JSON Schema, make an effort to modify it so it's shaped more towards stock JSON Schema.
 *
 * Why do this?
 *
 *  1. OpenAPI 3.0.x supports its own flavor of JSON Schema that isn't fully compatible with most JSON Schema tooling
 *    (like `@readme/oas-form` or `@rjsf/core`).
 *  2. While validating an OpenAPI definition will prevent corrupted or improper schemas from occuring, we have a lot of
 *    legacy schemas in ReadMe that were ingested before we had proper validation in place, and as a result have some
 *    API definitions that will not pass validation right now. In addition to reshaping OAS-JSON Schema into JSON Schema
 *    this library will also fix these improper schemas: things like `type: object` having `items` instead of
 *    `properties`, or `type: array` missing `items`.
 *  3. To ease the burden of polymorphic handling on our form rendering engine we make an attempt to merge `allOf`
 *    schemas here.
 *  4. Additionally due to OpenAPI 3.0.x not supporting JSON Schema, in order to support the `example` keyword that OAS
 *    supports, we need to do some work in here to remap it into `examples`. However, since all we care about in respect
 *    to examples for usage within `@readme/oas-form`, we're only retaining primitives. This *slightly* deviates from
 *    JSON Schema in that JSON Schema allows for any schema to be an example, but since `@readme/oas-form` can only
 *    actually **render** primitives, that's what we're retaining.
 *  5. Though OpenAPI 3.1 does support full JSON Schema, this library should be able to handle it without any problems.
 *
 * And why use this over `@openapi-contrib/openapi-schema-to-json-schema`? Fortunately and unfortunately we've got a lot
 * of API definitions in our database that aren't currently valid so we need to have a lot of bespoke handling for odd
 * quirks, typos, and missing declarations that might be present.
 *
 * @todo add support for `schema: false` and `not` cases.
 * @see {@link https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-validation.html}
 * @see {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md#schemaObject}
 * @see {@link https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md#schemaObject}
 * @param data OpenAPI Schema Object to convert to pure JSON Schema.
 * @param opts Options
 * @param opts.currentLocation Current location within the schema -- this is a JSON pointer.
 * @param opts.globalDefaults Object containing a global set of defaults that we should apply to schemas that match it.
 * @param opts.isPolymorphicAllOfChild Is this schema the child of a polymorphic `allOf` schema?
 * @param opts.prevSchemas Array of parent schemas to utilize when attempting to path together examples.
 * @param opts.refLogger A function that's called anytime a (circular) `$ref` is found.
